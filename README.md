### Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize my programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
## Wins:
1. Learning how to start a webpage from scratch and connect CSS, JS, and HTML was so much fun and I feel like I have a better grasp now for how they all work together. 
2. I completed the MVP for this project very early on, after 2-3 days, giving me plenty of time to add extra features.

## Challenges:
1. The extra features on the "View All Messages" were a bigger challenge than I imagined. The edit message feature was a challenge because it took me a while fully grasp how much I needed to put into it; each button (submit, cancel, and delete) and their event handlers.
2. Making sure everything is fluid and there are no errors or bugs was a challenge. I realized after submitting the new messages, I had to run both my resetMessages() funtion and the makeMsgEditable() functions again.
